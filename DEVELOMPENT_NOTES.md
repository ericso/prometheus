## TypeScript Testing Issues & Solutions (May 14, 2025)

### PostgreSQL Pool Mocking in Tests
**File**: `postgres-user.service.test.ts`
**Issue**: Type errors when mocking pg Pool's query method
**Solution**: 
- Properly typed mock pool implementation:
```typescript
const mockPool = {
  query: jest.Mock<Promise<QueryResult<User>>>,
  end: jest.Mock
};
```
- This ensures type safety while maintaining the correct interface for pg Pool's query method

### Controller Dependency Injection
**File**: `auth.controller.test.ts`
**Issue**: Type mismatch between PostgresUserService and mocked UserService in AuthController constructor
**Learnings**:
- Identified tight coupling between controller and concrete implementation
- Suggested improvement: Controller should depend on interface rather than concrete implementation
- Better follows dependency injection principles and makes testing easier

### Database Migrations System
**Location**: `src/db/migrate.ts`
**Status**: Fully Implemented
**Features**:
- Migration scripts properly implemented
- Package.json contains necessary migration scripts
- Supports both up and down migrations

**Configuration**:
- Environment variables need to be documented
- Migration commands available through npm scripts

### Testing Best Practices Learned
1. When mocking complex interfaces like pg Pool:
   - Ensure mock types match the original interface exactly
   - Pay special attention to Promise return types
   - Use Jest's typing system effectively for mocks

2. For dependency injection:
   - Design classes to depend on interfaces rather than implementations
   - Makes testing more straightforward
   - Reduces coupling between components

3. Database interaction testing:
   - Properly type database query results
   - Consider using a test database for integration tests
   - Ensure migrations can be reversed for test cleanup

### Next Steps
1. Update README.md with environment variable documentation
2. Consider refactoring controllers to use interfaces
3. Document migration procedures
4. Consider adding integration test suite with test database
